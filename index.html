                            <p>My research experiences in university began in the second semester of my first year. 
                                I have continued to work on research every semester and summer since then.
                                Two of my projects have been peer-reviewed and published in Mathematics Magazine and the NordiCHI 2024 Proceedings.
                                Most of my projects have been in the field of SHCI, Sustainable Human-Computer Interaction. 
                                I have become extremely passionate about this field and am always eager to learn more.

                            <p>I was the TA for a Data Structures and Algorithms I course occuring in Summer 2025. 
                                I host weekly office hours for students to attend and ask clarifying questions about course content, projects, and lab assignments.
                                I also graded these projects and labs, giving detailed feedback to all students in order to help them improve their skills. 
                                As the semester continued, a majority of students showed improvement on these projects and labs. 
                                Many of these improvements seemed to be directly related to feedback I provided on past assignments.
                            </p>
                            <p>I was asked to TA for the Competitive Programming course occuring in Spring 2025. 
                                I was primarily chosen due to my firsthand experience in competitive programming through being Vice President of Villanova's Programming Team. 
                                I attended the weekly class sessions to assist the professor and help students.
                                During these classes, I helped host in-class programming competitions and mock interviews. 
                                Outside of class, I graded student assignments, reported feedback to the professor, and was available to answer students' questions during my own office hours.
                                In addition, the professor made an extra credit opportunity for students who practice on Kattis, a website hosting coding problems. 
                                If they passed her score, they would get 3 bonus points. If they passed the head of the CS department, they would get 5 points.
                                Lastly, if they passed my score, they would get 10 points since I am one of the highest ranked users at Villanova.
                                This opportunity for the students has also served as motivation for me to continue increasing my score in order to maintain my position.

                                I then met with and was hired by Simon Brooks, a PhD student for Sustainable Engineering at Villanova.
                                He tasked me with creating an open-source web tool to display the findings of his Carbon Calculus<sup>TM</sup> research in an interesting and interactive manner.
                                I have been working on this project during Summer 2025, meeting weekly with Simon and Dr. Cooney to iteratively improve designs and functionality.
                                I am using HTML/CSS and ReactJS to create the website and am temporarily hosting it on GitHub Pages.
                                The website contains interactive charts and graphs created with PlotlyJS.
                                Throughout the project, we sought feedback from other Sustainable Engineering PhD students and Professors, using their comments to iteratively improve the user experience.
                                We are currently preparing a presentation for Villanova's SICJS, Strategic Initiative for Climate, Justice, and Sustainability.

                                        Over the summer, we discussed over email that he needed a website that demonstrated the Kelly Criterion in the form of a betting game. 
                                        The requirements he sent me were as follows: <ul>
                                            <li>A person opening the website would be given an account with starting capital of $100</li>
                                            <li>They’d be able to choose a percentage of their current capital (from 0 to 100% inclusive, in whole percentages) to bet on heads for the next coin toss.</li>
                                            <li>The coin toss would have a probability of p = 0.6 to come up heads. The probability p should be adjustable.</li>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>If the coin comes up heads and the player wins, the player would have the amount bet added to their current capital.</li>
                                                <li>If the coin comes up tails and the player loses, the player’s capital would be reduced by the amount bet.</li>
                                            </ul>
                                            <li>Repeat until a maximum of N=100 coin tosses is reached. This N also needs to be adjustable.</li>
                                            <li>Each time, the player first chooses the percentage to play, then the coin “is tossed” (via a random number generator), and the win/loss added to the account.</li>
                                            <li>If the player reaches a maximum of $1000 or above, at any time of the game, the game ends, and the player is given the $1000.</li>
                                            <li>If the player ever bets 100% and loses, the game also ends for the player. The player’s payoff is $0.</li>
                                            <li>If the player does not reach the maximum, the player receives the amount in their account after 100 games.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        I worked on this project over the summer and emailed multiple versions of the website to him for comments. These comments were taken into account and I edited the website accordingly.
                                        The method for data collection I used took the results of each game and submitted them to a Google Form. I set up a Google Sheet to automatically format the received data.
                                        The professor was able to access, edit, and analyze the data. The link to this website is above. 
                                        The professor is no longer using the website, so any data submitted to the website will still be sent to the Google Sheet, but it will not be analyzed.

                            <p>I worked on this project with a Computer Science research team under Dr. Sarah Cooney, the same people from my #AntiHaul project.
                                It references back to my research regarding #sheinhaul and #thrifthaul. It is categorized as SHCI, a field exploring Sustainable Human-Computer Interaction. 
                                I created Python programs utilizing YouTube Transcript APIs to generate the transcripts of #haul YouTube videos.
                                These programs also used Beautiful Soup as an HTML parser to collect articles from newspaper databases that related to sustainability.
                                The team then performed lexical analysis to compare the transcripts/texts of #sheinhaul, #thrifthaul, and sustainability newspapers. 
                                We are currently writing a research paper detailing our findings for Villanova's Undergraduate Research Journal.

                            <p>I worked on this project with a Computer Science research team under Dr. Sarah Cooney. It began through Villanova's Undergraduate Research Fellowship (VURF) during the summer and has continued into the school year as I was hired as an Undergraduate Research Assistant for Fall 2024. 
                                It focuses on the #antihaul trend on YouTube, expanding on my previous research on #sheinhaul and #thrifthaul. It is categorized as SHCI, a field exploring Sustainable Human-Computer Interaction. I created Python programs utilizing YouTube's Public Data API to create a subset of videos that may be related to #antihaul.
                                Due to the unreliable nature of the API, I then manually reviewed each video to ensure it was properly related to #antihaul and belonged in our dataset. The team each watched these videos and noted video creator motivations informed by previous research. We searched for correlations between creator motivation and viewer engagement, but we found minimal correlation. 
                                I created a poster describing this research and presented with my team at Villanova's Undergraduate Research Symposium in November 2024. We have also presented at the VU Women in Tech conference in January 2025.

                                    <p>I worked on this project with a Computer Science research team under Dr. Sarah Cooney. It applied through Villanova's First-Year MATCH Program and was chosen by Dr. Cooney to join the team.
                                        It focused on the #haul trend on YouTube, specifically examining #sheinhaul and #thrifthaul. It is categorized as SHCI, a field exploring Sustainable Human-Computer Interaction. I created Python programs utilizing YouTube's Public Data API to create two subsets of videos. One subset was meant to be related to #sheinhaul, and the other related to #thrifthaul.
                                        Due to the unreliable nature of the API, the team then manually reviewed each video to ensure it was properly related to its related hashtag and belonged in our dataset. The team each watched these videos and noted elements of pro-consumption or anti-consumption. We found these themes in the videos themselves, in the video's description, or from the comments. 
                                        We analyzed this data with a focus on sustainability on VSPs (video sharing platforms). My team worked to create a full research paper which was submitted and accepted to NordiCHI 2024. It is published at the link above.

                                    <p>I worked on this project with a Mathematics research team under Dr. Alexander Diaz-Lopez. It applied through Villanova's Co-Master Program and was chosen by Dr. Diaz-Lopez to join the team.
                                        We explored the Tower of Hanoi and its known, most efficient solution. We aimed to find an equation which could determine the peg that any given disk was on at any given move. 
                                        As the only Computer Scientist on the team, I took on the role of creating simulations of the game to verify our equation on millions of inputs. I created these programs using Python and shared them with the team.
                                        We then proceeded to verify our solution through mathematical proofs. Our team created a slideshow and presented at the EPaDel conference at Albright College and Villanova's Mathematics Symposium. 
                                        In addition, I created an informal website where users could input any move number and see the location of every disk in a 50-disk Tower of Hanoi. It was intended to be accepted on mobile devices by people attending the conference and is available at the above link.
                                        Additionally, we submitted our final paper to Mathematics Magazine where it was officially published in July 2025.

                            <p>I had initially joined this club in January 2024 and was elected to be the Co-President in April 2025. This club is truly a tight-knit community of female Computer Science majors. We meet every other week to discuss recent updates in the field, work on school assignments, discuss programming projects, and spend time together. 
                                When I attended the ICPC competition in November 2024 with the Programming Team, I was the only woman alongside 6 men from Villanova. Similarly, for the PACISE competition in April 2025, I was the only woman alongside 11 men.
                                This club has truly made me feel much more accepted in Computer Science and has encouraged me to stand my ground in this male-dominated field. We are now a group of 30+ and are expecting new members to join this academic year.</p>

                                The Aspirations in Computing (AiC) Award is given to women and non-binary high schoolers who display passion and talent for computer science.
                                It is distributed by the National Center for Women & Information Technology (NCWIT). More information about the award is available at the above link.
                                I helped to plan and host a banquet in April 2025 for the local and national winners in the Philadelphia area.
                                This academic year, we plan to visit local high schools in Philadelphia and the surrounding area to inform students about this opportunity.
                                This club has the ability to expand beyond this award and focus on encouraging high schoolers to learn aspects of computer science.

                            <div class="subheading mb-3">Vice President</div>
                            <p>I was unable to join the Programming Team formally in my freshman year due to my course schedule, but practiced on the same website, <i>Kattis</i>, that the official team used. I am now ranked 4<sup>th</sup> individually in Pennsylvania and plan to continue increasing my score.
                                Kattis and similar programming challenges have become some of my favorite pastimes. I was able to officially join the team at the beginning of my sophomore year and was soon named Vice President. 
                                I competed in my first coding competition with this team in November 2024. Our team traveled to Wilkes University to compete at the ICPC Competition in Division 2 for the Mid-Atlantic region. My teammate and I worked on programming problems in Python for five hours. 
                                We each solved a few problems individually before working together on the more difficult ones. When the competition concluded, my teammate and I had solved the most problems and placed 1st at the location. We later found we were 8th in the entire Mid-Atlantic region. 
                                My role on this team aided in my hiring as a TA for a Competitive Programming course in Spring 2025. 
                                Additionally, the team's faculty advisor has named me Team Captain, so I am responsible for leading the weekly meetings for our nearly 100 members, catering to those with varying levels of coding proficiency.

                                It lasted for nearly two months over the summer with multiple meetings each week. These meetings were conducted virtually over Zoom and consisted of lectures and group projects with students nationwide. 
                                We programmed in Python and were able to send our code to one of IBM's quantum computers.
